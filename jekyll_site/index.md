# Pinouts and Cables!

This is a super-simple website to view the output from 
https://github.com/tarxvftech/cables without having to do any work.

The entire website and all pictures are automatically updated when
changes are made to the source code there.

## Cables

Here you will find the cables with known definitions.

{% include gallery.html folder="images" %}

## Connectors

Here you might one day find a reference of the connectors themselves
to make a master repository of pinouts. But not today! I have work in
the morning.
