  - type: Generic Serial TTL
    pinlabels: 
      - "VBUS"    #1
      - "TX"      #2
      - "RX"      #3
      - "GND"     #4
      - "s"       #shield
    pincount: 5
    notes: "Tx and Rx naming convention is that on each device they\n are labeled to match the behavior of that device - e.g. TX as\n labeled on a chip is the pin that chip will transmit on. This means\n you cross-connect serial devices, so a wire connects two devices A\n and B by connecting GND:GND, A_TX:B_RX and B_TX:A_RX. It is fairly\n common to not connect VBUS, which is most often 5v or 3.3v."
