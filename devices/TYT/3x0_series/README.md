It's a kenwood K2 pin, but it's _raw usb_, there is no serial port involved anywhere.

You cannot use the TYT cable with radios expecting a serial port, or a cable with a serial port with these radios.

This connector pinout is used for very nearly all dmr handhelds with a
common lineage (HRC5000, HRC6000 chips) and the same connector - but not quite all.
